# Case Insensitive Commands
This plugin makes all your commands case insensitive.
Since 1.19.2 all commands became case-sensitivie to match a vanilla behaviour, this plugin brings back the old functionality.

# Compilation
To compile this plugin you need to execute the 
```./gradlew clean build``` command in your terminal.
